    <h1>Sanjay Adhith</h1>

    Welcome to my website.

    <img src="gravity.jpg" alt="My favourite cartoon character" style="height: 300px; width: auto;" align="right">

    <p>I am an undergraduate Mathematics and Computer Science student.</p>

    <p>Recently I have been studying the Coq Proof Assistant.</p>

    <p>I can be reached via <a href="mailto:sanjay.adhith@u.nus.edu">email.</a>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>My hobbies include walking, swimming and cycling. <br>I walk a lot, about 10 kilometers or so a day at minimum.<br> Sometimes I will walk dozens of kilometers, listening to rock music.</p>
    <p>I enjoy comics, cartoons, movies and stand-up comedy. <br>I enjoy funny and absurd things a lot, I'm not a serious person and delight in tricks and slights of hand.</p>

    <h2>Books I am reading</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Adventures in Group Theory: Rubik’s Cube, Merlin’s Machine, and Other Mathematical Toys
        by David Joyner</li>
      <p id="review">This is a pleasurable read. I am slowly and admiringly wandering through this text.</p>
      <li>Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms by David McKay</li>
      <p id="review">David McKay strikes a perfect balance between theory and application. This book is excellent and I expect to continually return to it. I watched most of his video lectures on YouTube too.
        If you're looking to get into the "Machine Learning" discussion, a solid grounding in probability, information theory and coding theory is essential.

        <li>The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth Volumes 1, 4a and 4b</li>
        <p id="review">I'm mainly into puzzles and recreational maths at the moment so I'm focusing on these volumes. I am trying to work through all the
          exercises rated from 00 to 30. I am also reading the fasicles on Constraint Satisfaction Problems and the collection of puzzles. He writes well, I like his style.
        </p>
        <p id="review">I think Knuth knows that he won't be able to finish writing about sequential programming in his lifetime and so has decided to become a recreational mathematician, 
          which is excellent news for me.</p>

        <li>Information, Physics and Computation by Andrea Montanari and Marc Mézard.</li>
        <p id="review">I used this book as a guide to look up the relevant topics in other books and papers. The exposition is sketchy at times, but clear and suitable for beginners like me.</p>
        <li>An Introduction to Mathematical Logic by Herbert Enderton</li>
        <p id="review">A poorly written book, but your options are limited if you want to learn logic. Honestly, I recommend sitting in on a few classes or taking a course like I did.</p>
        <li>Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler</li>
    </ul>
